#Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect and recognize sign language gestures from images or video input.
The goal is to enable communication for the hearing-impaired by translating sign language into text or speech in real-time.

Features
Detects sign language gestures in real-time using deep learning models.

Converts detected sign language gestures into corresponding text or speech.

Built with TensorFlow/Keras (or other deep learning libraries).

User-friendly and easy-to-extend for various sign language datasets.
