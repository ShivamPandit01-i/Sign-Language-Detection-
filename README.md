Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning

Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning is an AI-powered project designed to detect and recognize sign language gestures from images or video input. This tool aims to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired by translating sign language gestures into readable text or audible speech in real-time.

Features

Real-time Gesture Recognition: Detects and identifies sign language gestures from live video streams or static images using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Text & Speech Conversion: Converts recognized gestures into corresponding text and speech, enabling effective communication.

Built with Deep Learning Frameworks: Developed using TensorFlow/Keras, with flexibility to integrate other deep learning libraries if needed.

User-Friendly & Extensible: Easy to use, modify, and extend for different sign language datasets and custom gestures.

Technologies Used

Deep Learning: TensorFlow / Keras

Computer Vision: OpenCV for image/video processing

Audio Output (Optional): pyttsx3 or other text-to-speech libraries
